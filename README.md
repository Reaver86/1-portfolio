# Website of Alexander Schuster

This is my private website, which I'm updating irregularly as soon as I find time for it.

## Develop locally
It is built using npm and gulp, so you'll need to run "npm install" and "gulp" to get started.

In the unlikely event that you might want to contribute, I'll gladly have a look at your pull requests.
